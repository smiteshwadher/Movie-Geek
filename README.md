# Challenges Faced 😔 -> 😃

So, here is my experience while developing this application :

1) The first and the foremost was to understand & Implement the working of the Latest MVVM / MVVM-C architecture.

2) The Major Gap between the Swift 3 UI for which I was familiar with, but to jump from Swift 3 to Swift UI was an another major challenge which I looked upon as an opportunity to inculcate myself with the current trends in Native iOS Application development.

Well, to be honest the previous week was quite adventurous as I have been working on this application along with my official work.

I am really glad that I had this opportunity which helped me to polish the latest trends in Native iOS Application development. Hope you enjoy this project.... 😊
